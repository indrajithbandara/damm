Damm Checksums
==============

Numeric implementations of [Damm Checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damm_algorithm) in Python and C.

Every implementation of the Damm Checksum I could find were turning the number to be checksummed into a string and then looping over the characters. This is my attempt at writing purely numeric implementations in Python and C.
